But this hardly imaginable situation has now occurred. First of all, I would like to state that I was not promised any benefits for this post and that I purchased the book quite regularly in a store. It is the book &lt;em>The Phoenix Project - A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win&lt;/em> by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Phoenix Project inimitably tells the story of Bill Palmer, a midrange computer department manager at Parts Unlimited, an auto parts manufacturer. Parts Unlimited&amp;rsquo;s market situation is very tight, with competitors always one step ahead. Bill&amp;rsquo;s survival tactic has always been to fly under the radar and not stand out. So the day comes when Bill, running late for work, is called into her office by the HR manager on his way to work. Once there, he learns that his boss and his boss&amp;rsquo;s boss, the CIO, are no longer with the company and that he is now to become the head of IT operations and that this choice was made by the CEO himself. Bill firmly intends to refuse the promotion, but somehow the charismatic CEO Steve Masters manages to run him over in conversation so that he does not manage to refuse the promotion.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
